## Deep learning in Python

DeepPy tries to combine state-of-the-art deep learning models with a Pythonic interface in an extensible framework.


### Features
 - Pythonic programming interface based on NumPy's ndarray.
 - Runs on CPU or Nvidia GPUs when available (thanks to [CUDArray][cudarray]).
 - Feedforward networks
   - Dropout layers.
   - Convnets layers: Convolution, pooling, local response normalization.
 - Siamese Networks
 - Training module
   - Stochastic gradient descent.
   - Interchangeable learning rules: Momentum, RMSProp.
   - Regularization: L2 weight decay.
 - Dataset module
   - MNIST, CIFAR10


### Installation
First, install [CUDArray][cudarray]. Then install DeepPy with the standard

    python setup.py install


### TODO
 - Dropout normalization of weights.
 - Documentation!
 - Support for regression problems in feed forward neural network.
 - Other network types (autoencoders, stochastic neural networks, etc.).
 - Interactive training method with visualization.


### Influences
Thanks to the following projects for showing the way.
 - [scikit-learn][http://scikit-learn.org/]
 - [Caffe][http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/]
 - [Pylearn2][http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/]
